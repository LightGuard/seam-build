The JBoss Community formatting, as established by the AS7 project, is very
similar to the standard Sun formatting, with the exception of a few minor
corrections for consistency:

*  JavaDoc parameter information is on the same line, not indented
*  Line length is 128 characters
*  Spaces are used instead of tabs
*  Switch blocks are indented
*  Indentation size is 4 (Java and XML files)
