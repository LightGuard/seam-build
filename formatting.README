The JBoss Community formatting, as established by the AS7 project, is very
similar to the standard Java formatting convention, with the exception of a few
minor corrections for consistency:

*  JavaDoc parameter information is on the same line, not indented
*  Line length is 128 characters
*  Spaces are used instead of tabs
*  Switch blocks are indented
*  Indentation size is 4

The formatting rules for XML source follow suit:

*  Line length is 128 characters
*  Spaces are used instead of tabs
*  Indentation size is 4
